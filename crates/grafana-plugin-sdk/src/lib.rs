/*! The Grafana Plugin SDK for Rust.

This crate contains a Rust implementation of the Grafana plugin SDK. It is divided into three main modules:

- [`backend`] contains the traits that must be implemented by backend plugins for various pieces of functionality,
  whether querying data, calling resources, or streaming data between Grafana and the plugin.
- [`data`] contains the fundamental data structures used by backend plugins, such as [`Frame`][data::Frame]s, [`Field`][data::Field]s,
  and their associated metadata.
- [`live`] contains functionality used by [Grafana Live], the streaming messaging service available from
  Grafana 8.0.

The [`prelude`] contains some useful unambiguous traits which are helpful when creating some structures,
particularly [`Frame`][data::Frame]s and [`Field`][data::Field]s.

Backend plugins communicate with Grafana via gRPC. The low-level protocols are exposed in the [`pluginv2`]
module as an escape hatch, if required. Please file an issue if this is needed and we will try to
accommodate your needs in the next release of the high-level SDK.

See the docs on [backend plugins on grafana.com] for an introduction to backend Grafana plugins, or check out
the [crate examples] or [sample app repo] to get started with writing a backend plugin in Rust.

# Feature flags

The following feature flags enable additional functionality for this crate:

- `reqwest` - adds an [`IntoHttpResponse`][crate::backend::IntoHttpResponse] implementation for
   [`reqwest::Response`]
